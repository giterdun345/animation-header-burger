I ask a lot of questions to ensure I can work out every little detail for an optimal solution. I strive to build trusting relationships with my clients and provide the best creative solutions based on an understanding of their needs.

                        Successfully completing a project is, of course, satisfying but it is the process to completion that I enjoy the most. It entails accomplishing smaller challenges, learning about new things and sharing ideas with others. Sometimes it feels like playing with legos again as a kid. Each block added is a component of the main objective and should be placed strategically leading to some creative solutions.

                        <p>
                            I began my journey with programming as a front-end developer. As I learned more, I started with back-end design and ultimately discovered data science. 
                            With strong math skills, and experience with design, data mining, algorithm implementation and abstraction work, I felt I was well suited for a career transition.
                            I found it exciting to create visualizations, build statistical models, computer vision utilize NLP techniques and knew this was what I wanted to do. 
                            I have learned discipline and hard-work from the Marine Corps, listening and communication skills from teaching, and while working myself through college as a business owner, I learned perserverence, marketing, sales and finance.
