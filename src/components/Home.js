                        For as long as I can remember, I've been obsessed with learning about the latest and greatest; no language is too different, pattern too difficult, or process too challenging.

                        Lately? I've been building GraphQL API's using TypeScript, developing infrastructure tooling, and architecting elegant Client-side solutions at Credit Karma.

                        Some of my must haves: test driven development, scalability, thoughtful and meaningful code review, and setting up build pipelines for success. */}
